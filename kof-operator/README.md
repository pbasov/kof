# kof-operator

[Promxy](https://github.com/jacksontj/promxy) configuration is a list of serverGroup pointed to provisioned storage clusters.

This operator dynamically builds and reloads the promxy configuration as `PromxyServerGroup` custom resources are deployed along with storage cluster.

## Description

This is not a generic kof-operator, but rather an automation workaround for KOF as the promxy-config [template](internal/controller/template/secret.tmpl) is limited to KOF implementation so far.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### Build and Deploy on the cluster for Development

From the repo root makefile

```sh
make dev-ms-deploy
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete PromxyServerGroup <name> -n <namespace>
```

**Delete the Mothership helm chart from the cluster:**


```sh
helm del kof-mothership -n kof

```
